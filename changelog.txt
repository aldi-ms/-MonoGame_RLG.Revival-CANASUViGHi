-> 23.01.2015
After several fixes (mainly map scroll and field of view) I am starting a 
change log to keep track of updates / changes on the code under this project.
To denote a new update or change the line will start with *. All posts will
be separated with an empty line, as well as start with line in format:
"-> dd.mm.yyy"
