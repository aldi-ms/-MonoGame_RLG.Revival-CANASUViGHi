	TO DO LIST

-> Update and clear up the DrawMap code, as well as the FOV calc

-> Write a PriorityQueue for keeping the unit actors?

-> Menu probably need improvement, looking like / prone to spaghetti code (and errors).

-> Implement a way to print tiles in the color they are (instead of using fontColor in Draw Map code).
